# SitoExpress SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle
SE SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle is made on top of SiteOrigin own's widget bundle and it adds some useful widget able to work well with the Page Builder by SiteOrigin.

## Basic info
* It relies on `Sauce Library` for complete functionality
* It requires `Page Builder by SiteOrigin` and `SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle`, as is meant to work with them
* Please note that most widgets come from custom-made design needs in real projects, meaning that a blank/barebone setup might need some css maquillage (aka additional styling in your custom child theme). This matter will be addressed in future release to provide a more consistent design out of the box.
